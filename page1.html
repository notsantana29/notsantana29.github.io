            <p>This data is pulling from the top 1000 rated movies on IMDB, so there may be some bias there, but from what we can see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over the past 100 years there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between a movie being highly rated and a movie having high gross earnings.</li>
                <li>The maximum gross earnings a film has achieved has increased over time, and more and more films are getting to very high gross earnings.</li>
                <li>The number of movies by decade increases in the dataset as time goes on, so there is likely a recency bias involved with ratings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, are movies making more? And is there a recency bias?</p>

                <li>We can see the total gross earnings of these movies are definitely increasing as the decades go on, but we're also including a lot more movies from recent decades.</li>
                <li>However, the highest grossing movie is increasing very sharply, but we're not accounting for inflation, so that is likely skewing things.</li>
                <li>Regardless, it is an upward trend in gross earnings, but the average IMDB rating is staying pretty similar.</li>
                <li>So movies may not be getting better or worse, but the market is still there and growing apparently.</li>
